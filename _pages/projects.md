Here are selected projects from my academic and professional career:

### 🚦 Vehicle Conflict Modeling Using Post-Encroachment Time (PET)
- Developed stratified duration models using Weibull distribution to estimate PET durations.
- Explored duration dependence and lag structures across multiple conflict events.
- Tools used: Python, Limdep

### 🧠 Bivariate Copula Model for Crash Type Severity
- Built joint probability models for crash type and severity using copula functions.
- Captured correlations and tail dependence between outcomes.

### 🌐 Traffic Network Safety Analysis
- Used NetworkX and Gephi to model 178-node urban signalized intersection network.
- Analyzed network centrality and travel time-weighted shortest paths for crash frequency modeling.
